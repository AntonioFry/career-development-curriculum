# Agile & Feedback Reflection Guidelines
In interviews, you'll be asked about how you approach working in projects, and being able to describe how you utilize agile processes is a great way to help you stand out as a junior developer candidate. This reflection is meant to help you develop this skill.

With that in mind, please answer the following questions in your own gist about your group project:

1. What have you learned about the use of agile vs. waterfall in software projects? 
  - Agile is very useful for prioritizing smaller tasks within a longer timeframe and big projects. 
2. How did you and your group approach project management in this project (what tools did you use, how did you hold each other accountable, etc.)?
  - We set tasks for one another and tried to divy up work when we had to work remotely. Otherwise we did driver/navigator.
3. What role did you take on in the project? 
  - I felt our grouped worked a an equal level, and we all took charge of our own parts of the project. So I felt somewhat like a leader.
4. What changes would you make to your approach in future team projects?
  - I would like to communicate more when working. I felt we were very distant at times and sometimes new additions to the project made it hard to read what was happening.
5. How does retro function in a team project?
  - It helps set guidelines for how we will work. For our group it was more of a compromise and goals for how we worked on the project. i.e when working on something and you get stuck, seek help from one another.
6. In your team retro, how did you engage in the feedback process? What principles of feedback did you use in these conversations?
  - We always pushed eachother to re-factor our work to make it nicer and challenged eachother to try different ways of doing things.
7. How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills? How do you want to improve in your ability to communicate feedback?
  - We were very honest, but also did it in a calm manner that would not offend.
